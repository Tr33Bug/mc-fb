# Phase 2: Single Column Navigation

## Summary
Add keyboard navigation to browse files with up/down arrow keys and visual selection

## Changes

- Implemented up/down arrow navigation with boundary checking
- Added visual selection indicator (> prefix and cyan color)
- Dynamic re-rendering on selection change
- Status bar shows selected item information
- Support for q, Q, ESC, and Ctrl+C to quit

## Technical Details
- Keyboard handler uses event-driven pattern
- Arrow key sequences properly detected (ANSI escape codes)
- Re-render only when state changes
- Selection bounds checking prevents out-of-range errors

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/keyboard.ts` - Keyboard handler and key codes
